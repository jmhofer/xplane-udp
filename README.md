# xplane-udp

Experiments with a UDP client for X-Plane.

# Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a Scala library with a good API to access
X-Plane easily via UDP.

This enables you to read a lot of "data refs" from X-Plane, and also to remote control it.

# Status

Currently, this is just a playground. Don't expect anything that is ready for use yet.

# Prerequisites

- have some Scala knowledge
- have a version of X-Plane (tested with X-Plane 11)

# Building

- install [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/)
- run `sbt`
- make sure to have X-Plane running
- to run the main program, type `run` into the sbt shell

# Contributing

If you want to contribute, go ahead, just create a PR, I'll be happy to take a look at it.

Please don't always expect prompt responses, though, as this is just a small hobby project 
of mine.
